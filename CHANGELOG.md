0.2.0-1.4
------------

This is identical in functionality to 0.2.0 but built against Kotlin 1.4. This version is not considered

0.2.0
-----

_2020-01-25_

**New:** There's now a batteries-included `redacted-compiler-plugin-annotations` artifact with a `@Redacted`
annotation you can use if you don't want to manage your own. The `redacted` Gradle extension now defaults
to this and will automatically add this annotations artifact to your project dependencies if a custom
one isn't set. This means that, if you use the default, then all you need to do to use this plugin
is simply apply the gradle plugin ðŸŽ‰.

0.1.0
